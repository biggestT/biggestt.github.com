I am 26 years old, weigh around 85 kilos and am almost 2 meters tall, so to some extent numbers do define me. But I wanted to go further in quantifying  myself. So, before Google did it, I wanted to measure what I actually spend my, perhaps valuable, time doing during one week. 

Time tracking
----------------

This obviously stupid experiment consisted in me having an android time-tracking application constantly present. I divided my life into 8 categories so that it would give me a neat overview. When I was startin to eat or cook I turned on the food-category timer and then when I took a shower I turned on the hygiene-category timer and so on. Of course there were times when I felt like I was in between categories but then I just chosed the one that best portrayed the activity as a whole.

 I got somewhat fucked in the brain. I started noticing the paradox that goes something like: “you can’t measure something without affecting it”. Because by being limited to doing only one activity at a time, my life became much more concurrent and discretized than it usually is. Before doing this I would have assumed that having a clock constantly ticking in the background, when performing everyday activities, would have a stressful effect on me. On the contrary this limitation to only do one thing at a time was rather relaxing. It also made me more productive in a sense because no-good activities like just browsing Facebook were simply non-worhty of doing while the time was literally ticking away. But how accurate and honest were these measurements?

Of course I needed at least one other measurement to check this. So one month later I once again entered time tracking mode and this is what that resulted in:

One can notice that the division of the categories is somewhat similar so I was satisfied to conclude that my measurements, while not always being very exact, still conveyed a supposedly correct image of how I spend my time. And in retrospect no matter how stupid I felt while doing this (especially people I met while “socialising”)  I consider it being time well spent.
