Since censored Chinese Internet isn’t that much fun I felt like I had to go off the line and into the wild. Nothing stopped me from hitchhiking the Northwestern part of the Yunnan province and I soon found myself in a car with a local park ranger. He told me that the guidebooks (2011 edition) telling me that I couldn’t go straight from Deqin to Gongshan were wrong. Apparently I could take a two day hike across the mountains and he sketched down how to go about doing this. Those few lines of text brought me into quite a mess of half stupid shit that was a bit more than I asked for, but just exactly what I needed in order to appreciate whatever Chinese internet has to offer.

As soon as I arrived in Deqin (3320 meters altitude) I hastily summoned a council of locals to help me in my quest of defying the guidebooks. One Tibetan guy called a friend and we settled a deal that they would take me on the two to three days hike for a total of 800 Yuan. I considered this to be a fair expense since I had enjoyed free food and transport from friendly people during all of the 600 kilometers it took me to get there.   

The real adventure took off when I walked across the stream on a hanging bridge that lead to the small Tibetan village. I then met one of the self-acclaimed guides and he started to lead me to his house. We  then heard a loud blast and  he told me that it was the Chinese that were trying to build a road across the mountains that I were supposed to pass. They hadn’t got very far though and suddenly my guide started running on the small mountain path that we were on. That’s when I first realized that I wasn’t on an organized group tour and I too started running just like a guy that runs from explosions would run. My guide told me that he did not like the road project since they were taking pieces of the old mountain and I quickly agreed for whatever reason. I then spent a day and a night enjoying Tibetan family life with the two guides that proved to be a couple in their early twenties with two adorable kids.  But no internet and no electricity make a high tech swede feel restless so I was glad when we headed out for the trek the following morning.  

Nature then quickly swallowed us as we followed the cow herders path into the mountain pass. I haven’t been to the alps but the nature we saw seemed like a postcard from Switzerland. When I saw a hawkish bird roam the sky above us in a paradisy grove I was most definitely on top of life. The path then suddenly lead us up over a mountain covered in snow and my overly content smile turned into the frown of a man with poor balance. We had to dig in our jogging shoes in the snow to get a grip and lean against bamboo sticks in order to not fall down the mountainside. The snow also made my guides lose track of the small path. We started to get more and more exhausted and once in awhile someone slipped down a bit on the snow until they found some vegetation to grab on to. After three hours of this struggle I found myself exhausted and accustomed to the fact that we might be lost in the wild. Then the rational and biggest part of myself told me that the only thing that connects me to these people is 800 yuan. I also got the feeling that their own fear had passed the 800 yuan limit and that they were now also concerned for their own safe return. They went ahead of me and didn’t really look back that often. Being pissed for guides not doing guide stuff properly wouldn't help me here so I tried to be super nice to them. I even showed them my compass to show them that I could be to some use in spite of my slow speed. My best picture of the future at this point was me struggling alone through this inaccessible vegetation. The worst was me falling down and hurting myself so that they would leave me and I would blow my whistle pipe the best I could. Death was then actually and rationally not that far away in my mind. Surprisingly this new reality became normal to me pretty fast. Humans adapt. 

路! 路! (Road! Road!) Screamed one guide and my mind came as close to embarrassment as it had been to despair just a minute ago. But the road was not the small path they had been looking for. This was a dirt road used by the chinese construction workers that also on this side of the mountain tried to improve their country's infrastructure. The tibetans were now literally overrun by the surprise of this roads existence. This being their first walk across the mountain of the year they had no idea that the construction had gotten this far. So as the high tech swede that I am I assumed the road to be very beneficial for me. And indeed it was when the workers noticed my presence and I cashed in all the benefits that being a tall scandinavian guy in China brings. I got free beer, food and cigarettes and a four wheeled ride to the nearest town. I so ended up leaving this supposed-to-be-three-days-hike after 12 hours of hardcore walking. It was a bit sad to see the faces of the Tibetans having face planted into the chinese government's demolition of their natural habitat. Hitchhikers obviously likes roads and this one especially saved my ass but the look of this young couple's faces still moved me. I actually felt a bit like the shitty tourist that I try so hard not to be.

For the record I will try to bring an emergency GPS tracker next time.
