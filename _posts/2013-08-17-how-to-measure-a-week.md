I am 26 years old, almost 2 meters tall, weigh around 85 kilos and to some extent numbers do define me. Still I wanted to go further in quantifying myself. So, before Google did it, I decided to measure what I actually spent my, perhaps valuable, time doing. 

Life Discretized
----------------

This stupid experiment resulted in me using an android time-tracking application during one week in January 2013. I ended up dividing my life into 8 major categories in order to make the final result comprehensible. These are the categories I choosed:

 **Rest**: sleep etc.
 **Exercise**: working out
 **Hygiene**: shower, tooth brushing, toilet etc.
 **Internet**: TV shows, Facebook, browsing, slacking etc.
 **Food**: cooking, buying food, eating
 **Socialize**: spending time with other persons doing anything except someting belonging to other categories
 **Work**: school, project work, reading
 **Transport**: moving between places


 When I was startin to eat or cook I would turn on the food-category timer and then when I took a shower change to the hygiene-category timer and so on. Of course there were times when I felt like I was in between categories but then I just picked the one that best portrayed the activity as a whole. Of course I improvised a lot.

Time is ticking
----------

 While trying to enjoy this otherwise rather normal week I started noticing the paradox that goes something like: “you can’t measure something without changing it”. Because by being limited to performing only one activity at a time, my life became much more focused and discretized than it usually is. Before performing this experiment I would have assumed that having a clock constantly ticking in the background, when performing everyday activities, would have a stressful effect on me. On the contrary this limitation to only do one thing at a time made me more relaxed. It also made me more productive in a sense because no-good activities like just browsing Facebook were simply non-worhty of doing while the time was literally ticking away. But how accurate and honest were these measurements? I would say that the ticking timer very much made me change my behaviour because I was so conscious about it. More subtle way of time tracking would of course be possible but I believe that just being aware, in any way, about your time being tracked does, to some extent, change your behaviour.
