I am 26 years old, almost 2 meters tall, weigh about 85 kilos and to some extent those numbers define me. Still I wanted to go further in quantifying myself. So, before Google did it, I decided to measure what I actually spent my, perhaps valuable, time doing. 

Method
----------------

This stupid experiment made me use an android time-tracking application during one week in January 2013. I ended up dividing my life into 8 major categories to make the final result more comprehensible. These are the categories I choosed and some examples of what they could consist of:

 **Rest**: sleeping, napping
 **Exercise**: working out, running
 **Hygiene**: showering, tooth brushing
 **Internet**: Facebooking, browsing, slacking
 **Food**: cooking, buying food, eating
 **Socialize**: spending time with friends doing anything except someting belonging to other categories
 **Work**: studying, working on projects, reading
 **Transport**: being inbetween places


 When I started to eat or cook I would turn on the Food timer and then change to the Hygiene timer when I started taking a shower and so on. Of course there were times when I felt like I was in between categories but then I just picked the one that best portrayed the activity as a whole. Of course I improvised a lot.

Result

Discussion
----------

 While trying to enjoy this otherwise rather normal week as a student, I started noticing the paradox that goes something like: "one can’t measure something without effecting it”. Because by being limited to perform only one activity at a time, my life became much more focused and discretized than it usually is. I would say that the ticking timer very much made me change my behaviour because I was so conscious about it. More subtle ways of time tracking would of course be possible but I believe that just being aware, in any way, about your time being tracked does, to some extent, change your behaviour. 

###PS.
I actually ended up recording another week in the same manner but that JSON file somehow dissapeared. Never ever loose track of files while tracking time!
