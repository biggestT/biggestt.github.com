I am 26 years old, almost 2 meters tall, weigh around 85 kilos and to some extent numbers do define me. Still I wanted to go further in quantifying myself. So, before Google did it, I decided to measure what I actually spent my, perhaps valuable, time doing. 

Life Discretized
----------------

This stupid experiment resulted in me using an android time-tracking application during one week in January 2013. I ended up dividing my life into 8 major categories in order to make the final result comprehensible. These are the categories I choosed:

- **Rest** (sleep etc.)
- **Exercise**
- **Hygiene** (shower, tooth brushing, toilet etc.)
- **Internet** (TV shows, Facebook, browsing, slacking etc.)
- **Food** (cooking, buying food, eating)
- **Socialize** (spending time with other persons doing anything except someting belonging to other categories)
- **Work** (school, project work, reading)
- **Transport** (moving between places)


 When I was startin to eat or cook I would turn on the food-category timer and then when I took a shower change to the hygiene-category timer and so on. Of course there were times when I felt like I was in between categories but then I just picked the one that best portrayed the activity as a whole. Of course I improvised a lot, and yes, having sex is a way of socializing.

Time is ticking
----------

 While trying to enjoy this otherwise rather normal week I started noticing the paradox that goes something like: “you can’t measure something without affecting it”. Because by being limited to doing only one activity at a time, my life became much more focused and discretized than it usually is. Before performing this experiment I would have assumed that having a clock constantly ticking in the background, when performing everyday activities, would have a stressful effect on me. On the contrary this limitation to only do one thing at a time made me more relaxed. It also made me more productive in a sense because no-good activities like just browsing Facebook were simply non-worhty of doing while the time was literally ticking away. But how accurate and honest were these measurements? I would say that the ticking timer very much made me change my behaviour because I was so conscious about it. More subtle way of time tracking would of course be possible but I believe that just being aware, in any way, about your time being tracked does indeed affect your behaviour. 

<!-- Of course I needed at least one other measurement to check this. So one month later I once again entered time tracking mode and this is what that resulted in:

One can notice that the division of the categories is somewhat similar so I was satisfied to conclude that my measurements, while not always being very exact, still conveyed a supposedly correct image of how I spend my time. And in retrospect no matter how stupid I felt while doing this (especially people I met while “socialising”)  I consider it being time well spent.
