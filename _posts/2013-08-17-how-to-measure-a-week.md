I am 25 years old, weigh around 90 kilos and am almost 2 meters tall, so to some extent numbers actually do define me. But I wanted to go further than that in this attempt to quantify myself. So what else except my body do I possess, that is important enough for me to measure? 

Time tracking
----------------

So, before Google did it, I wanted to measure what I actually spend my valuable time doing during one week. 

![Time spent on different categories of activities, scroll over a category to see details](time.js2dcanvas)

While performing this obviously stupid experiment, with an android time-tracking application constantly present, I got somewhat fucked in the brain. I started noticing the paradox that goes something like: “you can’t measure something without affecting it”. Because by being limited to doing only one activity at a time, my life became much more concurrent and discretized than it usually is. Before doing this I would have assumed that having a clock constantly ticking in the background, when performing everyday activities, would have a stressful effect on me. On the contrary this actually proved to have a somewhat soothing effect. It also made me more productive in a sense because no-good activities like just browsing Facebook were simply non-worhty of doing while the time was literally ticking away. But how accurate and honest were these measurements?

Of course I needed at least one other measurement to check this. So one month later I once again entered time tracking mode and this is what that resulted in:

One can notice that the division of the categories is somewhat similar so I was satisfied to conclude that my measurements, while not always being very exact, still conveyed a supposedly correct image of my life. And in retrospect no matter how stupid I felt while doing this (especially people I met while “socialising”)  I consider it being time well spent. 

You are what you own
--------------------

Even though I consider today’s form of static ownership to be [stupid](http://thingsbook.se), I still want to let my possessions be the measurement unit of choice for the second part of my experiment. So stay tuned and perhaps you will soon see the complete catalogue of my possessions with numbers and colors and graphs and everything!
