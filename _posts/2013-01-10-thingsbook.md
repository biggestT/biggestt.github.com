In a time where everyone shares everything, it is now time to share our physical belongings as well. Thingsbook is about connecting our things in the same way social networks connect people today. This would allow for things to be easily resellable, instead of like today, where each person needs to create a new ad each time he or she wants to sell something. E-commerce and secondhand trading is currently booming and Thingsbook wants to disrupt the current ad-based system in which these profitable businesses operates. Thingsbook is meant to be an unprecedented social material network. By creating an infrastructure for material sharing, Thingsbook will make our planet smile when material possessions are no longer kept hidden away from the benefits of online networks. Most of us have more things than friends - so let's organize them too!

The development of Thingsbook is currently on hold since I am focusing on finishing my master degree but will hopefully be continued soon enough.
