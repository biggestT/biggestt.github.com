Today we own things in a rather old-school way. While our social lives have become increasingly connected and digitally managed, our material possessions have not yet been invited to the same kind of networking.

Tings is about giving physical products digital profiles. It's about you having a digital representation of your possessions that can be viewed and shared with people you trust.

## Goals
- Prolong the lifetime of things by giving them persistent profiles that follow them instead of the ad-based system of today.

- Use smartphones and NFC technology to turn everyone into a walking library of things.
