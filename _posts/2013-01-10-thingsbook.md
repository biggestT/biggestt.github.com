Today we own things in a pretty static way. While as our social lives are becoming increasingly connected, our material possessions have enjoyed little of the digital fruits of this connected era.

Thingsbook is about connecting physical things and their owners in a distributed way. It's about you carrying around a digital representation of your possession and connecting it to friends you really trust. The Thingsbook way of sharing lets you use more while owning less.

I am currently working on an initial prototype to demonstrate this concept. The prototype utilizes the Dropbox API for client side authorization as well as image hosting. The client is backed up by a simple Node.js server side that is connected to a Neo4j graph database. Hopefully I can showcase all of my belongings there sometime during this winter.
