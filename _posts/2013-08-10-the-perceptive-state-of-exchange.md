Obviously you will seem like a lonetard as soon as you proclaim your plans of flying solo on a trip. But then you soon realise that alone only is one less than together and sometimes its even more than that. Sometimes you need to hang out with a place instead of your friends. This is what happened when i hanged out with my buddy Burma ..  


So before i went to Burma I did not know what to think because politics are very complicated. It has been said though that politics thinks of you whether or not you think of them. Therefore it calls for some research to come as a tourist to a country that until recently was run by a military junta. That is if you don't want to come of as merely a kill-kony-freedom-fighter. Still me, myself and I ended up not doing so much research and only motivated my presence, and therefore unavoidable monetary support to the government, by a simple thought. I thought that seeing is better than believing and without actually seeing Burma it wouldn't make much sense to believe in what you hear about it. Finally i got this confirmed from Aung San Suu Kyi when she changed her opinion about people visiting her country. I also came to the conclusion that in order to experience the country more I should travel alone and hence let all my senses be open. 

As soon as i left my friends in the streets of Rangoon I started seeing more cats. These cats were independent and intiguing and of course I wanted to be just like them. I felt confident in my newfound cat-swag and instantly bumped into just as intriguing burmese people. They got me into journalist mode when they started talking about wages, politics and religion in their country. In that context it is easy for us europeans to go into missionary mode where you start preaching about democracy and other delicious concepts. This all escalated when I preached the gospel of (democratic?) house music on the top of an ancient stupa in the temple city of Bagan. The two local teenagers seemed decently pleased with Avicii whileas I was on the top of the contemporary world. I then later felt like an imperialist asshole when I got a poor woman hooked on Angry Birds. 

The only one that could bring me down back to the orange soil of this country was a Burmese Barack Obama that was selling local art in the shade of a tree that produced shadow. He was the only person I met in Burma that had perfect teeth. No one should ever underestimate the value of perfect teeth since they provide an amazing frame for the words that comes out of that persons mouth. He told me that he was one of the few poor burmese people that was straight edge. He didnâ€™t chew betel nut which is widely used as the poor mans cigarette in Burma. His aura of extreme pride was striking in the modest settings that surrounded us. .
