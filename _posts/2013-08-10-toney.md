Toney is meant to be an online game similiar to Singstar but with the purpose of learning to pronounce Chinese tones correctly. Toney is one of the Linköping University's Summer of Code 2013 projects. [View the development blog](http://biggestt.github.io/toney/about.html). I want to thank Gustav Mårtensson for help with the pitch detection algorithm and InnovationskontorEtt for feedback on the general idea.
