Toney is meant to be a game similiar to Singstar but with the purpose of learning to pronounce Chinese tones correctly. Toney was one of the Linköping University's Summer of Code 2013 projects. You can read more about the development at the [development blog](http://biggestt.github.io/toney/about.html).

## CREDITS

The IDA institition at Linköping's University for paying me to work on the project during June 2013.

Gustav Mårtensson and Emil Axelsson for help with the pitch detection algorithm.

InnovationskontorEtt for feedback on the general idea.

## The Future

Currently the pitch detection [isn't very accurate](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17943429/how-can-i-utilize-the-full-spectrogram-resolution-when-dealing-with-speech-input) with the data retrieved from the HTML 5 web audio API. It would therefore be reasonable to perhaps instead implement the game as a native Android or iOs application. If I have time I will try to do that at some point.
